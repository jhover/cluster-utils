Hi John,

The data and rdata directories share a quota.

The /grid/ paths are currently bind mounts to the actual /mnt/grid/ paths. When sonas was the primary storage system for 
HPC the NFS exports had been mounted at /sonas-hs/ on BnB and a lot of the internal pathing requirements were hidden from 
users. With grid the gpfs filesystem was directly mounted on the nodes so the full paths with some redundant naming 
(for example /mnt/grid/gillis/hpc/data/data/ ) was exposed. To minimize the migration impact the new paths were symlinked 
to /sonas-hs/. With the move to Elzar the /sonas-hs/ paths are being abandoned which means users have to change anything 
that's hard coded. We're planning some filesystem changes down the road which will require a new mountpoint for the whole 
filesystem other than /mnt/grid. We decided to preemptively create the new mountpoint /grid/ and bind mount from /mnt/grid 
paths to /grid/ similar to the symlinks that were in place for /sonas-hs/. This does obfuscate some information like the 
shared quota between data and rdata (they are both directories under /mnt/grid/hpc/data/ ). You can find what paths are 
bind mounted with the findmount command. Long term we'll be moving the data around on the file system and will reach out 
about how to restructure the quotas. We will be able to have one shared quota for /grid/gillis/, or dedicated quotas for 
each directory. I expect that is a year or two out.

Thanks
      -Alex
